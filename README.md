ServiceNow Batch API - 
An example of using this API using PowerShell

The official documentation only gave a CURL example

This blog entry in the community is useful and tried to add to the doco and make it more useful.

What I wanted to see was a working example that I could use, preferably in PowerShell.

I managed to get it working after a bit and though I might place it here for anyone to use.
